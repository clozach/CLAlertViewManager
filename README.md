CLAlertViewManager offers a mild improvement over directly using UIAlertView. It uses the title or message of your alert to prevent the user from seeing duplicate alerts. It also includes a block-completion method allowing you to add actions to alerts without implementing UIAlertViewDelegate.

All of the information you need to use it is in CLAlertViewManager.h.
